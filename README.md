# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Installation Instructions
1. Please run the milestone_4.py file.

Usage Instructions
1. Please key in your guesses when prompted to. The game will end when the user correctly guesses the full word, or when the user runs out of lives
by incorrectly guessing 5 times.

File Structure
1. Main file is milestone_4.py, which contains a class for the game. The class contains methods for getting input from the user, and for then
checking the validity of the guess, along with checking if the guessed letter is in the word. The word is selected randomly from a list in the
milestone_2.py file. Some known bugs still to be fixed: the game sometimes accepts entry of more than one character, and can terminate the game
early as a result of prematurely thinking the user has guessed the full word. This will be fixed in next update.

Licence Information
